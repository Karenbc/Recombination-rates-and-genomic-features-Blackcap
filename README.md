This repository holds the scripts used to estimate recombination rates and annotate the genome. 
It contains three main folders:
i)   Calling Variants: It contains the scripts used to call SNPs from re-sequencing data.
ii)  Estimating recombinatin rates: It contains the creation of the lookup-table, hypearam, rates estimation, conversion and windows calculation.
iii) Genome annotation:
