This repository holds the scripts used to estimate recombination rates and annotate the genome. 
It contains four main folders:

i)   **Calling Variants**: It contains the scripts used to call SNPs from re-sequencing data.

ii)  ****Recombination rates****: It contains the scripts used for estimating, converting and calculating recombination rates in windows. 

iii) ****Genome annotation****: It contains the scripts used for the anotation of the genome based on RNA-seq and Iso-Seq data. 

iv) **Genomic features**: It contains the scripts used for CpG island identification, calculation of nucleotide diversity (pi) and GC content across the genome.
